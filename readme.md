Infinite Chess began as an indie project by [Naviary](https://www.youtube.com/@Naviary) in 2022, inspired by the concept of chess and infinity, he started towards the goal of creating a place where all people can experience this sensation of freedom and exploration in the world well-known as "Chess". More than just a game of strategy, it mirrors life itself. Creation, conflict, resolution. The laws of the universe, elements, and time. **Tear down the barriers!** Step into the unknown. It is time for your next adventure.

It is free, ad-less, and open source! If you have skills in html, css, javascript, or Node, we welcome contributions! To get started collaborating, please read the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)!

We are still far off from our vision. We refuse to stop until all crucial elements of this universe are founded:
- Truly infinite move distance.
- Games with infinitely many pieces.
- Knightriders, and other exotic pieces.
- Rating system, with leaderboards.
- Themes, colors, board textures.
- Board Editor
- 4 Player
- Massive Multiplayer Online
- Premoving
- Highlighting squares, drawing infinite lines.
- Snapping to easily threat pieces.
- and more! This list is not exhaustive.
